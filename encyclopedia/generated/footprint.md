## definition

The set of entries a reader reads. What the reader reads decides how warm and how stale the reader is. Chapter 13 section 13.3.

## equation

Book equation 0.26.

    \mathrm{FC}=\Pr\big[W\ \text{refutes}\ \big|\ \mathcal C_t\ \text{clears}\big],\qquad \text{coverage}=\Pr\big[\mathcal C_t\ \text{clears}\big].

Book equation 13.2.

    \begin{gathered} T_{\mathrm{coh}}=\frac{0.423}{f_D}, \\ \text{refuted fit:}\ \ \phi\approx0.177\,T_{\mathrm{coh}}\ (R^{2}=0.915), \qquad \text{sealed:}\ \ \phi\le 6\ \text{TTI at }10\ \text{Hz},\ \ 1\ \text{TTI at}\ \ge50\ \text{Hz}. \end{gathered}

Book equation 13.1.

    \mathrm{FC}=\Pr\big[W\ \text{refutes}\ \big|\ \mathcal C_t\ \text{clears}\big],\qquad d_O(\Delta)=\operatorname{tr}\big(P_C\,M_{\mathrm{drift}}(\Delta)\big),\qquad M_{\mathrm{drift}}(\Delta)=\mathbb E\big[\delta_\Delta\delta_\Delta^{\top}\big].

- GO-12. The dynamic region's opening control — staleness is access width, not delay: with full context-path access, pure-delay aging is information-free (the recoding identity $(Y,V,S^{(\Delta)})\overset d=(Y,V,P^\Delta S^{(0)})$ makes every $\sigma(S)$-measurable conditional functional exactly $\Delta$-invariant; circulant-exact, $O(1/n)$ edge leakage on finite windows); with time-local slice access the tax is GO-11's static quadratic with the substitution set by the \emph{encoder's} access — single-letter $(Y_t,V_t)$ records at $(\rho,\ s/a^{2\Delta})$, context-epoch-latent records at the strictly smaller $(\rho a^\Delta,\ \tau^2)$ (gap up to $0.053$ bits) — both strictly increasing in $\Delta$ with common limit $\tfrac12\log_2(1/D)$. GO-8's age-dependence is the slice regime's operational face. Theorem 1 (the conditional-variance reduction) settles the causal-prefix eraser in the single-record setting: every observation-subset $\sigma$-algebra enters through $q_{\mathcal G}=\mathrm{Var}(V_t\mid\mathcal G)$ alone; slice/prefix/path = single-sample/Kalman-fixed-lag/noncausal-Wiener variances; strict interpolation at every finite lag with exact gap $C^{2\Delta}(P_f-q_{\mathrm{path}})$; $W(\Delta)=kT\ln2\cdot L_{\mathrm{prefix}}$ is the dynamic conditional-Landauer curve. Theorem 2-spectral (070): the spectral conditional RDF — at the work endpoint, $L(D)$ is the equal-slope allocation of per-frequency static quadratics over the circulant spectrum, with classical reverse water-filling ($\tau^2\to\infty$) and the static theorem (flat spectrum) exact; per-mode convexity proven; the third promotion of the water level completed for the single-consumer face; Toeplitz transfer scoped imported-with-lemmas, $O(1/n)$ numerics. The weighted spectral theorem (071) closes Conjecture 1 at circulant scope: $J_w$ decomposes per-frequency at every $w$, each mode carrying Theorem 3's two-water-level system $(\gamma_0(\omega),\gamma_1(\omega))$ under ONE common distortion price (the conjectured ``pair of prices'' refuted-as-phrased, rescoped to $(w,\mu)$); convexity via the full-region moment argument + perturbation. The third promotion is complete on BOTH faces. `[predicted]`. `geometric-observation/claims/LEDGER.md:78` at 9f3829f.

none

## conditions

- The set of entries a reader reads. The hit rate is one when the cache holds the footprint and does not move when entries outside it are added, so what the reader reads decides how warm, and how stale, the reader is.
- A replica is stale because of what the reader asks for. The hot reader read a false-clear rate of 0.99 and the cold reader 0.01 on the same store, and the aggregate described neither.

Conditions are curated in `entries.toml` rather than read from a record.
